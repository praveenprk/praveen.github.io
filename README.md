# Dummy

Dummy makes it clear what elements on the page are "dummy" info (i.e.
still need to be implemented on the backend) by making them visibly different
from other elements on the page. This makes it easy to tell what still needs to
be done in development.

## Usage

In your main application styling page, add a script for dummy and a link
to it's stylesheet.

```
<script src="https://thoughtbot.github.io/dummy/toggle-dummy.js">
</script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
href="https://thoughtbot.github.io/dummy/toggle-dummy.css">
```

You will need to add the `dummy` class to any elements in your UI that
aren't complete on the backend.

The default behavior is to reduce the opacity of dummy elements in your UI when
dummy is active. You can also overwrite this behavior by modifying the styling
for the `.dummy.is-active` elements in your application. For example:

```scss
//dummy.scss

.dummy {
  &.is-active{
    background-color: red;
  }
}
```
